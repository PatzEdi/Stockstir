To install Stockstir, you need to run the following command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip3 install Stockstir

This will install both the Python library and the command line interface (CLI). After installation, you can use Stockstir in two ways:

1. As a Python library in your code (see :ref:`function use`)
2. As a command line tool by typing ``stockstir`` followed by a stock symbol (see :ref:`cli`)

.. code-block:: console

   $ stockstir AAPL
